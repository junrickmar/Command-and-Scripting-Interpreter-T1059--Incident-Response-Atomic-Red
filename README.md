# Atomic Red: T1059-Command and Scripting Interpreter Incident Response
In this lab project, I simulated a basic script execution attack by running an Atomic Red script called "AutoIt Script Execution" in a Azure Windows virtual machine. 
‚ÄúScript execution attacks‚Äù are when a bad actor infects your endpoint with malware that uses a ‚Äúscript interpreter‚Äù (in this case, AutoIt.exe) to automatically launch malicious programs within the target machine, silently. This typically happens when you download this malware from a website or click a malicious link. In this lab, the ‚Äúmalicious program‚Äù that will be remotely launched by this attack will be Windows Calculator. Once the attack runs successfully, I then conduct an incident response investigation based on NIST 800-61 guidelines.
